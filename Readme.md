## 🔎 Idea overview

As a technologist, I want to analyze a Penpot interactive prototype flow and generate a set of user stories and documentation meant to describe the technical work needed to implement them.

## 💡 Feature analysis
### Approach #1 | Documentation generation from “cleaned” SVG [[More](Approach-Documentation_generation_from_cleaned_SVG/)]

## ✨ Demo [[→](Approach-Documentation_generation_from_cleaned_SVG/demo/ui2docs.ipynb)] | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/penpot/Penpot-C2_UX-to-Documentation-Generator/blob/main/Approach-Documentation_generation_from_cleaned_SVG/demo/ui2docs.ipynb)

Explore hands-on experience with the [demo](Approach-Documentation_generation_from_cleaned_SVG/demo/ui2docs.ipynb) of the proposed approach.

## 🏁 Final recommendation

The UX to Documentation Generator feature has *moderate risk and complexity*. 

The proposed approach of generating documentation from a cleaned SVG file using LLM with several prompts seems feasible and ready for implementation. However, further research and testing are recommended to ensure its stability in a real-world application.

This feature has the potential since there is no particularly similar work done in the area of design documentation. Meanwhile, the technological aspect of this feature is ready for implementation.
